Features that could be cool
* Make it easy to import data and then run some sort pipeline thing
    - i.e, i have this csv of location data, run another script that reverse geolcoates coordinates
* A custom MCP client web interface thing that like let's you explore the data, similar to datasette.io
* a gallery of diff python scripts that tell u requirements of difference connectors and gives u interesting insights


Adding connectors
* this is too much vibe coding, APIs are strucuted, data is strucutred, we shuold be able to automatically build API -> DB pipeline without relying on vibe coding a connector
